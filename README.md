These files are related to my master's thesis project.
I am teaching myself Python in order to rewrite programs that will:
1) Generate natural language phrases
2) Accept natural language input
3) Make inferences from the inputs
4) Paraphrase the inputs

The work is based on Roger Schank's Conceptual Dependency model from the 1970's written in LISP.

I have used the Anaconda Spyder IDE and Python 3.
